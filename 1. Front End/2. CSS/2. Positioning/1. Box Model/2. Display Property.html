  <p>
    If you want elements on separate lines, use display: block. You can adjust sizing how you see fit. <br>
    If you want elements on the same line and take up only as much space as large the element itself is, use display: inline. However, you cannot adjust sizing. <br>
    If you want elements on the same line and have freedom to adjust how you want, use display: inline-block <br>
