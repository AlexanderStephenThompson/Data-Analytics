// The limited choice of data structures Javascript has actually makes working with data very easy.
// Just have to know arrays are actually stacks and objects are actually dictionaries

// Note objects created from classes are the same as regular objects, just have a class associated with them to show where the object derived from.
// The order of the object's attributes listed alphabetically despite how you've ordered it in code.

// The DOM can return a lot of different and weird structures. If that's the case, you can probably use
// Array.from() to convert to a more usable format.https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from

/* Destructuring can be done to an object or array by assigning values based on a position 
of which something was defined. So, when destructuring, the order that variables are declared is important.

However, when you destructure an object, you do make a new variable for each attribute.
