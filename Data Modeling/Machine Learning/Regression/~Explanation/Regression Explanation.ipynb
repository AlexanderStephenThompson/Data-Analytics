    "# Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is supervised model which observers the relationship between a dependent target variable and an independent predictive variable(s) on a scatter plot by finding the best-fitting line of the two continuous attributes. It learns (Or evaluates) by checking its prediction against the actual though a metric called RSME, hence why it's a supervised model. This is useful if you see a visible trend in the data, if not, see if there are clusters you can have a model to try to detect. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three primary metrics that can be gained: Coefficients, R, and RSME.\n",
    " - Correlation Coefficients: Interpretable values of each independent predictive value, indicating how much a 1 unit increase will effect the target.\n",
    " - RSME: A measure of how close its predictions are to the actual values. \n",
    " - R: How closely the values fit the line. As in, the strength of a pattern we're able to catch.\n",

    "It's important to know which type of regression to use. Though it's pretty easy to figure out which one to see when you plot your data and see a pattern for yourself. It would be silly to do a linear regression on a plot that clearly has a polynomial like pattern, right? \n",
