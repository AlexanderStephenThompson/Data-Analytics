# Data Analytics

Data analytics can cover a very broad range of topics, but in general, it is the process of examining data sets in order to draw conclusions about the information they contain. This can be done with a variety of tools and techniques, and can be used to inform decision-making in a wide range of fields. 

For example, yes there are tools like Excel and Tableau, that can be used to analyze data, but there are also more advanced tools like Python that can be used for more complex analyses and modeling. Math other than statistics, like algebra and calculus, can also be used to help understand information you may have. Collectively, these tools will empower you to make better decisions and solve problems more effectively.
